PyFlux: time-series for Python
==================================

PyFlux is an open source time series library for the Python programming language. PyFlux allows for easy application of a vast array of time series methods and inference capabilities. Visit the website at http://www.pyflux.com for detailed examples and model explanations, or the GitHub page at http://www.github.com/RJT1990/pyflux.
